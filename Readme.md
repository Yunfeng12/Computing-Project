# Final Year Project/PC Scanner
To test PC Scanner that need three parts
1. To set up two Linux
2. Installing Nginx
3. Installing PC Scanner and Nmap
4. Running Nmap
5.	Running PCscanner



## To set up two Linux
First, prepare your Linux server* with a fresh install of CentOS, Ubuntu or Redhat, depends what you like.
In this case, I choose AWS [https://aws.amazon.com/] as my server. and then the few tings have to do 
1. IPv4 Firewall. I suggest open all ports from 0 to 65334

2. Start an editor, vi or whatever, and load the sshd config. Allow root login and password authentication by commenting/uncommenting: 
   > sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config.    PermitRootLogin yes  PasswordAuthentication yes

## Installing Nginx
look at picture there are 6 Nignxs, we need to install it

<img width="522" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92934877/156922243-fbeecb03-2206-4ffa-96de-470836cd0094.png">

### Number 1
1. Firstly, download the Nginx file from path Building-Nginx/nginx-1.16.1-1.el7.ngx.x86_64.rpm, or download from the official nginx website
2. Secondly, upload file to the linux via SCP or SSH
3. and then type command to install it
   > rpm -ivh  nginx-1.16.1-1.el7.ngx.x86_64.rpm
4. running nginx by typing the command
   > systemctl nginx start
5. checking the nginx status
   > systemctl nginx status
6. checking the webpage of nginx via browser in personal computer
   > http://52.221.235.236:80

the picture showing below meaning that nginx was successfully installed

### Number 2
1. Firstly, download the Nginx file from path Building-Nginx/nginx-portable-11.zip
2. Secondly, upload file to the linux via SCP or SSH
3. extract it 
  > unzip  nginx-portable-11.zip
4. change the default port from 80 to 100 and runing it
  > cd nginx/conf
  > 
  > vi nginx.conf

  > cd nginx/sbin
  > 
  > ./nginx
5. checking the webpage of nginx via browser in personal computer
   > http://52.221.235.236:100/

### Number 3
1. Firstly, download the Nginx file from path Building-Nginx/nginx-1.16.1.tar.gz, or download from the official nginx website
2. Secondly, upload file to the linux via SCP or SSH
3. extract it 
   > tar  -zxvf   nginx-1.16.1.tar.gz
4. Install compilation tools and library files, and PCRE
   > yum -y install make wget zlib zlib-devel gcc-c++ libtool  openssl openssl-devel
   > 
   > wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/pcre/pcre/8.35/pcre-8.35.tar.gz
   > 
   > tar zxvf pcre-8.35.tar.gz
   > 
   > cd pcre-8.35
   > 
   > ./configure
   > 
   > make && make install
5. and then intall nginx and config it
   > cd nginx-1.16.1
   > 
   > ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/nginx-port-103
   > 
   > make && make install
6. from now, nginx 3 have be installed, and then need change the default listen port from 80 to 101
   > cd /usr/local/nginx-port-101/conf
   > 
   > vi nginx.conf

7. checking the webpage of nginx via browser in personal computer
   > http://52.221.235.236:101/



### Number 4
Number 4ï¼ŒSame as number 3, but the only difference is that after unpacking and before compiling, you need to remove the nginx version in the nginx.h file and the line is "#define NGINX_VERSION".  until the compilation is complete, then go back and modify the nginx.conf file and change the port from 80 to 102
 > tar  -zxvf   nginx-1.16.1.tar.gz
 > 
 > cd nginx-1.16.1/src/core
 > 
 > vi nginx.h

after that the all steps are same as Number 3

### Number 5
Number 5 is same as Number, but modified nginx.h by removing the name nginx on the line #define NGINX_VAR and #define NGINX_VER. the port is 103

### Number 6
Number 6 is to remove the bath server name and version, is same as number 4 and number 5. the port is 103


## Installing PC Scanner and Nmap

###Nmap
For Nmap, it is very easy to install it by typing the linux command, or download from the official Nmap website
>yum install nmap

###PCscanner
1. install python, I suggest downlaod python file from official python website. only require python 3, any sub-version are ok
2. after install python, and installing some necessary libraries regex, python-Nmap, pandas, Paramiko
  > pip install regex, python-Nmap, pandas, Paramiko
3. and then copy program PCscanner to the Linux where Nmap installed here

## Running Nmap
